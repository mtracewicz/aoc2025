# Day 1
The easiest way to explore the program is by using Make.
- to compile the program
```bash
make
```
- to compile with debug symbols and logs
```bash
make make_debug=true
```
- to compile just part 1
```bash
make part1
```
- to compile just part 2
```bash
make part2
```
- to run the tests
```bash
make test
```
